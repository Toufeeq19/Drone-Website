                With professionals in RPAS operations, Phantom Frames™, provides RPAS consulting.
                We are aware of the particular requirements and distinctions between manned and unmanned aviation. Given that the majority of RPAS operators are not familiar with the commercial aviation industry, we have developed a set of operating manuals and procedures that account for this.
                In our capacity as a qualified operator we always offer our clients documentation that has been tried and tested in the field.Our manuals and procedures are appropriate for every person's unique level of aviation experience and are safe, compliant, and field-tested.</p>
               
            <h2 class="content-subheader">WE ARE SACAA COMPLIANT</h2>
            <p>
                This is valid for all users of the sky, including airplanes, helicopters, skydivers, glider pilots, etc. Drones can fly at great altitudes and fast speeds, which obviously has the potential to do significant damage in the event of an accident. Effective regulation is the greatest method to reduce these risks.
